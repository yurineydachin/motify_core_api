# Metrics for ElasticSearch #

[ElasticSearch](https://elastic.co) is the database and the search engine 
used in Lazada as full text and facet search. 

[Lazada Prometheus Metrics Naming Standard (v2.0)](https://confluence.lazada.com/x/OihVAQ)
declares two metrics for ElasticSearch:

* Response time in milliseconds.
* Number of facets used in queries.
